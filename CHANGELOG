//////////////////////
REMOVED/SUBSTITUTED:
//////////////////////

- Associate file icons by MIME type
http://hu2.php.net/manual/hu/function.mime-content-type.php
Reason: the required function is disabled on most hosts.
Only 3 type remains: folders, image files, other files.

- Display size not only of files but of folders, too
Reason: script execution time would probably get very high
especially when there were many folders, and also would 
probably cause high CPU/HDD load on the host.

- Check for uname
Reason: this would be needed for win hosts. But I realized that
I don't care about win :-). So if you need phpFB on win, you'll
have to fix it yourself, sorry.

- Make gallery look better.
Reason: I can't imagine a better scheme :-).
