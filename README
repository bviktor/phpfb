phpFB is a simple and easy to use PHP script which lists the content
of web folders. It is designed to look similar to common web servers.
Easily customizable and tweakable.

THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW
##################################################################

First of all: the way phpFB reports things is currently being
revised, so don't be surpised about arrays with one element etc :-)

------------------------------------------------------------------

The script itself is pretty simple IMHO, you can tweak it to your
needs, but I placed some of the important settings in the 
beginning of the script to make your life easier (see "OPTIONS").

------------------------------------------------------------------

To 'install' phpFB, you have nothing else to do but place it in a
folder which you want to show off to the public.

------------------------------------------------------------------

You shouldn't have folders with ".." in their names. For example:

PHP is...fun

You probably don't want such folders, but it's just better to make
clear. If you asked why, I would say this is needed to disable 
moving out the "root" directory (the directory which phpFB is 
placed in).

------------------------------------------------------------------

File uploads need a temporary directory. You can modify this only
if you have access to the host's config files. Hopefully you don't
have to care about this, but if uploads don't work for you, it's
your task to find out what's this dir. You might query it by
running phpinfo(), but it could be disabled on some hosts.

------------------------------------------------------------------

You can specify upload sizelimit in two ways. The first one is 
$up_size in phpFB's options section. The second one is to specify
it in @UPLOAD in bytes. This overrides the default value only to
its folder. Warning! If the file contains only spaces, you'll have
0 MB sizelimit in that folder. An example @UPLOAD could contain:

1024

Which sets sizelimit to 1 kB.

------------------------------------------------------------------

If the length of a file's name is more than 50 characters, it's
ending will be chunked till the 47th character, and "..." will be
placed in the end of it. Note that this applies to listing only,
no file names will be altered.

------------------------------------------------------------------

I setted up cells in the table to look acceptable both in Firefox
and Epiphany on Linux. If you have problems with viewing, please
let me know.

------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want your file to be hidden, start it with @. You could use
a point (.) too, but this is not recommended, it can cause problems,
especially on free web spaces.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Files ending to .mp3, .wma are not uploadable by default. It could
be disabled easily, look for "mp3" or "wma" and you'll see ;-).

------------------------------------------------------------------

PHP files are uploadable, but they will be renamed to .phps to
avoid hacks.

------------------------------------------------------------------

The uploader is not allowed to overwrite existing files. If you
want to upload something which has the same name, you have to
rename it.

##################################################################
IMPORTANT FILES THAT MODIFY FUNCTIONALIY
##################################################################

There are files which you can use to control the behaviour of the
script in each folder. Besides @HEADER they could be empty files.
(Actually @HEADER could be empty, too, but the use of would be
quite nonsense then.)

------------------------------------------------------------------

@VIEWER

Place a file called @VIEWER into the folder which you want to 
enable viewer in.

------------------------------------------------------------------

@HEADER

Place a file called @HEADER into the folder you want to have a note
displayed in top of it. It can contain more lines and HTML tags, too.

------------------------------------------------------------------

@PRIVATE

Place a file called @PRIVATE into the folder you want to hide from
visitors. Warning, this is not recursive, it applies to that single
folder only, subfolders are not affected.

------------------------------------------------------------------

@UPLOAD

Place a file called @UPLOAD into the folder which you want to
enable uploads in. This file can also be used to specify custom
sizelimits in any folder. This function was mentioned previously.

##################################################################
OPTIONS
##################################################################

$gfxdir = '@gfx';

This folder contains the necessairy icons which are required to
display the content properly. Enter the URL or path of your gfx
folder without ending slash. Both kind is accepted, examples:

$gfxdir = 'pub/files/gfx_dir';
$gfxdir = 'http://example.com/gfx';

------------------------------------------------------------------

$up_size = '2097152';

Here you can specify the maximum size of files (in bytes) that
one can upload using the uploader.

------------------------------------------------------------------

$chmod_enabled = '1';

This must be enabled to grant access to files uploaded via 
phpFB since some hosts don't provide access to them by default. 
If you know that this is needless on your host or the chmod()
function is disabled, comment it out with // or change "1" to 
anything you like.
